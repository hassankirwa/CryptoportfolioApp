# Project Title:Crypto Portfolio App
The script uses a function called "processData" to check the token and transaction type in each data row from the CSV file and adds or subtracts the amount to the corresponding total (btcTotal, ethTotal, xrpTotal) based on whether it's a deposit or withdrawal. It also keeps track of the number of valid data rows under the input date using the variable "validDataCount". Once the CSV file has been fully parsed, the script makes an API call to CryptoCompare to get the current USD value of BTC, ETH and XRP. Finally, it calculates the total portfolio value in USD by multiplying the total amount of each cryptocurrency by its current value and displays the result in the console along with the valid data count under input date.
